$ sls deploy
$ sls invoke --function demo # Yay! You will get texts of example.com
```

If your goal is to use selenium to download files instead of just scraping content from web pages, then
you will need to specify a `download_dir` when initializing the WebDriverWrapper. Your download location 
should be a writable Lambda directory such as `/tmp`. For example, the first code in 
`lambda_handler` would become 

```python
driver = WebDriverWrapper(download_location='/tmp')
```
If your goal is to use selenium to download files rather than just scrape content from web pages, then
you will need to specify a `download_dir` when initializing the WebDriverWrapper. Your download location
it must be a writable Lambda directory, for example `/ tmp`. For example, enter the first code
`lambda_handler` would become

`` python
driver = WebDriverWrapper (download_location = '/ tmp')
``

This causes file downloads to be automatically downloaded to the "download_location" without
require a confirmation dialog. You may need to let the manager sleep until the file is downloaded
because this happens asynchronously.

To download a file from a link that opens in a new tab (e.g. `target = '_ blank'`), you need to
call `enable_download_in_headless_chrome` in your scraping script after switching to the desired page, but before
click to download. This will replace all `target = '_ blank'` with` target =' _ self'`. For instance:

`` python
# Go to the download page
driver._driver.find_element_by_xpath ('// a [@href = "/ downloads /"]'). click ()
# Enable headless Chrome file download
driver.enable_download_in_headless_chrome ()
# Click the download link
driver._driver.find_element_by_class_name ("btn"). click ()
``

```python
# Navigate to download page
driver._driver.find_element_by_xpath('//a[@href="/downloads/"]').click()
# Enable headless chrome file download
driver.enable_download_in_headless_chrome()
# Click the download link
driver._driver.find_element_by_class_name("btn").click()
```
```
